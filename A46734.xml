         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note n="4" place="margin">Ground.</note> Chriſt himſelf the <hi>roſe of Sharon,</hi> I dare ſay is more ſweet then all your inward or outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles can be bitter, for he is as a ſweet roſe among all ſuch thornes, or thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46856:41"/>like afflictions; and he ſweetens them, though other roſes cannot ſo ſweeten the thornes among which they grow: even as that <hi>Tree</hi> did ſweeten the <hi>bitter waters of Meriba,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no body could drinke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. for he aſſures us, that how ever we ſpeed here and may be entertained in this world, we ſhall rejoyce in him, and live with him in glory at the laſt, as you have heard that he will quicken us as a roſe, and revive us after death, which is more then a roſe can doe: So as that needs we muſt gaine infinitely more by Chriſt then we can poſſibly loſe by him.</p>
               <p>And therefore as you take <hi>delight</hi> in a roſe, though it be among thorns, ſo take comfort and joy in Chriſt, though he be a roſe among thornes, that is, ſurrounded with a number of pricking, piercing, and heart-cutting vexations. If one ſhould rob you of all that you poſſeſſe, and you were made ſure at the ſame time of an orient Jewell in a ſure and a ſafe place, more worth a thouſand times then all that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46856:41"/>you loſt, I ſuppoſe you would not be ſo fooliſh, as to take on, and to vexe your ſelves about your loſſe; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoice at ſo rare a Jewell, whoſe prize doth ſo farre ſurmount the worth of all your other goods, which are nothing at all comparable to ſo precious a Jewell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And did not I aſſure you but now of Chriſt, <hi>the roſe of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> whoſe prize is <hi>above rubies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones,</hi> and whom yee can never loſe againe after ye have made him once your owne? and therefore I hope you will not be ſo fooliſh again hereafter, as to grieve immoderately at any afflictions or loſſes of goods or good name by wrongs or revilings; but rather rejoyce in Chriſt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that

               <p>More particularly, that like a Roſe he will purge out choler, and hatred, and luſtfulneſſe, and envie, and pride, and every other corruption, that you may be moſt troubled with, and that he will cleere your ſight, that you may ſee your ſinfulneſſe more then you did, and take away your ſtonie hearts, that you may be able to mourn or to grieve more for your ſinnes then you did, and that he will diſſolve all ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages within you, and enlarge your hearts, that ſo you may run after him in the way of his commandements, and that he will be pleaſed to eſtabliſh your hearts, and to pardon your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and to give reſt unto your ſouls, and to take away all trembling from your hearts. Moreover, pray him with all humbleneſſe of minde, that he will not ſuffer your graces to decay, nor to be ſo dead as ſometimes you are, but rather will quicken your
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46856:128"/>ſpirits, and when you be a thirſt after more grace, that he will ſatisfie you, and when you begin to thirſt too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately after the things of this life, that he will quench your thirſt, that you thirſt ſo no more, and when his fathers wrath is kindled againſt you, that he will appeaſe it, and when you be comfortleſſe and have loſt a deare friend, that he will comfort you, and when you are ſick in body and weake in faith, that he will ſtrengthen you. Thus according to the Caſes formerly proſecuted beſeech Chriſt to be good unto you, and if he ſeeme to be ſtrange, and inexorable then urge him, as the good Shunamite the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when her ſonne was dead, ſaying, <hi>As the Lord liveth and as thy ſoul liveth I will not leave thee,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.30.
